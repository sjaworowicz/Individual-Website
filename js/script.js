In 1962, the New York Mets became a baseball team. Then, in October 1969, the Mets won their first pennant, and world series as an organization. Then in October 1973, the Mets upset the Reds, bringing back their second pennant in history, but lost to the Athletics 4 games to 3 in the World Series.Then in 2009, the Mets said goodbye to Shea Stadium, and hello to Citi Field, which is their home field now. On June 1, 2012, Johan Santana threw the Mets first no hitter in franchise history against the Cardinals, recording 8 strikeouts, 5 walks, and 134 pitches. In 2019, Pete Alonso set an MLB record for most home runs for a rookie, as well as receiving rookie of the year, and Jacob DeGrom won the Cy Young award for 2 straight years, becoming the 11th pitcher in MLB history to win the award in back to back seasons."
